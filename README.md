# Calculator

This was definitely more difficult than I had intitially anticipated! When I started I thought it was going to be something I could do in 2/3 days tops. How wrong I was. 

The first part of getting the calculator to evaluate operation with only two numbers was quite easy, and I blame that for giving me and even more false sense of confidence. Once I started trying to evaluate more than one number things got pretty hectic. I just couldn't figure out how to approach it, it was just throwing me off so much. So, I took a break for a day, came back, and still couldn't figure it out. I did eventually manage to get it to work though and after that the other features kind of fell into place. But wow. It was quite fun though. I think what I enjoy most is that moment once you get something to work finally - there are few feelings equal to the fulfillment and satisfaction that brings.
